# Loan Eligibility Model Solution

## Purpose

The Loan Eligibility Model Solution project is designed to predict the eligibility of applicants for a loan based on various features such as income, employment status, loan amount, and more. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify applicants into eligible and ineligible categories, helping financial institutions automate the loan approval process. The primary objective is to develop a reliable model that can predict loan eligibility with high accuracy.



## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Loan_Eligibility_Model_Solution.git
cd Loan_Eligibility_Model_Solution

Install the Dependencies:
Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably 3.7 or above). Then, install the required Python packages:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Data:
Make sure your dataset is in the correct format and location. Update the data_loader.py script if needed to match your dataset structure.

Run the Main Script:
Execute the main script to train the model and evaluate its performance:

sh

python loan_eligibility_model_solution/main.py

View Results:
The script will display the classification report, accuracy score, and other relevant metrics to assess the performance of the loan eligibility model. You can use these results to fine-tune the model or proceed with the deployment.
## Dependencies

The project requires several Python libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file. Key dependencies include:

    pandas: For handling data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical computations and array operations.
    scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
    matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the results.
    seaborn: For creating more advanced visualizations.

To install these dependencies, run:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
